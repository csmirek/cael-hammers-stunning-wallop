This project is designed to be an Android equivalent to cael-hammer.  My intention is for the system to work in the same manner as the desktop version.  However, given current computational restrictions on smartphones and other Android devices, this cannot be fully possible and such things will be outlined at some point as more testing is done on various devices.
